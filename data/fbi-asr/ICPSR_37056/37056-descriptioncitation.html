		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> ASR, 2016</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> These data provide information on the number of arrests reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program each month by police agencies in the United States. Although not as well known as the "Crimes Known to the Police" data drawn from the Uniform Crime Report's Return A form, the arrest reports by age, sex, and race provide valuable data on 43 offenses including violent, drug, gambling, and larceny crimes. The data received by ICPSR were structured as a hierarchical file containing (per reporting police agency) an agency header record, and 1 to 12 monthly header reports, and 1 to 43 detail offense records containing the counts of arrests by age, sex, and race for a particular offense. ICPSR restructured the original data to a rectangular format.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Time Period(s):</strong> 2016</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> 2016</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> The data for the Uniform Crime Reports are submitted voluntarily by city, county, and state law enforcement agencies. Some agencies receive forms directly from the FBI and return them directly to the FBI. Many others receive forms from state collecting programs and return the reports to those programs. The state programs, in turn, forward the reports to the FBI. Reports are sent out and collected on a monthly basis.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Cross-sectional</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Arrests reported by law enforcement agencies to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting program.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> arrest counts</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> survey data, aggregate data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> mail questionnaire, on-site questionnaire</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Version History:</strong> <p>2018-06-28 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Created variable labels and/or value labels.</li><li>Standardized missing values.</li><li>Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
